# Project Idea: GitGocdVersionPlugin for Gradle

Warning, this is very experimental and not meant to be used in production environments.
It is also tailored for a special use case and for me it is a learning experience on how Gradle plugins work.

When continuous delivery is used, it can be valuable to have reliable version numbers which include the _commit ID_ and a _build ID_ pointing to a certain status in source code history and build pipeline run.
This can be achieved by using the [gradle-git-version plugin](https://github.com/palantir/gradle-git-version). In some cases, one would like to distinguish between local builds (e.g. performed on a developer PC) and automated builds in a CI/CD environment.

This plugin has the purpose to work with GoCD in order to detect if a build runs in a GoCD pipeline on a GoCD build agent.
Depending on that, the project version identifier will be updated.

There are no dependencies to other plugins.


## Semantic Versioning and Git

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes

A version number might look like: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g. 2.0.11)

The idea is, that the PATCH version can be directly taken from Git history.
One could `tag` a specific git commit with an appropriate `MAJOR.MINOR` value.
The count of commits after the last `tag` then represents the `PATCH` version.

Approach:
* declare `MAJOR.MINOR` using `git tag` command
* use commit count after last `tag` as `PATCH` version

The details here are provided by the [gradle-git-version plugin](https://github.com/palantir/gradle-git-version).
This provides an extension which makes it easy to get details such as the last tag, the commit distance, commit hash values etc.

## Combining Git with GoCD

Using GoCD so called piplines can be defined to build an artifact.
When a pipeline is running, it will have an id which is store in an environment variable `GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER`.

Now one can create a version such as: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.__BUILD__

This means, that just re-running the build pipeline, a new version number is created, which will help then to separate if a problem is caused by an erroneous build or by a bug in source code.
Another point is, that when the GoCD environment `GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER` is not detected, a deployment operation could be suppressed. This means, that e.g. local builds cannot be published into remote repositories.

# How does the Plugin work?

As of now for a Java library the Gradle code (Groovy DSL) looks as follows:

```groovy
plugins {
    id "java-library"
    id "com.palantir.git-version" version "0.12.3"
    id 'net.raumzeitfalle.gradle.gocdversion' version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'
}

# Git details are provided by git-version plugin
version = gocdVersion(versionDetails().lastTag+'.'+versionDetails().commitDistance,
                      versionDetails().lastTag+'.'+versionDetails().commitDistance+'-'+versionDetails().gitHash).build()
```

With that configuration, the created version number looks as follows:

#### Example 1, automated build in a GoCD pipeline
* git tag such as `1.0` exists
* there are NO commits behind `1.0`, the commit distance is 0
* the build is executed in a GoCD pipeline with `GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER=153.1`):

```
   # (tag.commit-distance.pipeline-counter)
   version = 1.0.0.153.1
```

#### Example 2, manual (local) build on developer machine
* git tag such as `1.0` exists
* there are NO commits behind `1.0`, the commit distance is 0
* the build is executed on a computer with name ENIAC, there is no environment variable `GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER=xyz`):

```
   # (tag.commit-distance-hash.computername.timestamp)
   version = 1.0.0-96bfec85d4.ENIAC.20210906000609  
```

Using the `gocdVersion` closure the versioning schema can be configured.

```groovy

# Defaults
gocdVersion {
    appendPipelineCounterToAutomatedBuilds = true
    appendComputerNameToLocalBuilds = true
    appendTimestampToLocalBuilds = true
}
```

The effective version number schema can be verified using the `printGocdEnvironment` task on commandline.

```shell
> ./gradlew printGocdEnvironment

Gocd Pipeline Environment
=========================

COMPUTERNAME         = ENIAC
GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER  =
Project version      = 1.0.0-96bfec85d4.ENIAC.20210906000609
Is automated build?  = false

```
