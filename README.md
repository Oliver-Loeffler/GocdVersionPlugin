# Project Idea: GocdVersionPlugin for Gradle

Warning, this is very experimental and not meant to be used in production environments.
It is also tailored for a special use case and for me it is a learning experience on how Gradle plugins work.

When continuous delivery is used, it can be valuable to have reliable version numbers which include the _commit ID_ and a _build ID_ pointing to a certain status in source code history and build pipeline run.

This can be achieved by using the [gradle-git-version plugin](https://github.com/palantir/gradle-git-version). In some cases, one would like to distinguish between local builds (e.g. performed on a developer PC) and automated builds in a CI/CD environment - this is the task of this plugin. 

This plugin has the purpose to work with GoCD in order to detect if a build runs in a GoCD pipeline on a GoCD build agent.
Depending on that, the project version identifier will be updated.

There are no dependencies to other plugins.

Version `0.0.1` works with Java-11 or newer, version `0.0.2` works again with Java-8 and newer.

## Combining Git with GoCD

GoCD uses pipelines to build artifacts. Each pipeline has a unique and independent environment and the pipeline instances are also versioned as well using the  environment variable `GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER`. With that it is possible to use the build count including the number of attempts for each build/pipeline instance within a version number. 

This means, that just re-running the build pipeline, a new version number is created, which will help then to separate if a problem is caused by an erroneous build or by a bug in source code. Another point is, that when the GoCD environment `GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER` is not detected, a deployment operation could be suppressed. This means, that e.g. local builds cannot be published into remote repositories.

# How does the Plugin work?

As of now for a Java library the Gradle code (Groovy DSL) looks as follows:

```groovy
plugins {
    id "java-library"
    id "com.palantir.git-version" version "0.15.0"
    id 'net.raumzeitfalle.gradle.gocdversion' version '0.0.2'
}

# Git details are provided by git-version plugin
version = gocdVersion(versionDetails().lastTag+'.'+versionDetails().commitDistance,
                      versionDetails().lastTag+'.'+versionDetails().commitDistance+'-'+versionDetails().gitHash).build()
```

In this example I've decided to go with the [gradle-git-version plugin](https://github.com/palantir/gradle-git-version) plugin to build the basic version number for a project. A version number might look like: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g. 2.0.11). 

The idea is, that the PATCH version can be directly taken from Git history. One could `tag` a specific git commit with an appropriate `MAJOR.MINOR` value.
The count of commits after the last `tag` then represents the `PATCH` version.

Approach:
* declare `MAJOR.MINOR` using `git tag` command
* use commit count after last `tag` as `PATCH` version
* A new, automatically created version could look like: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.__BUILD__ (or MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.__GO-PIPELINE-COUNT__)

The `gocdVersion` function takes 2 arguments, the first one is the string to be used as version for automated builds, the second one for manual or local builds.
So the effective version for a project can be different for atomated builds and manually initiated builds.

With the configuration in the example, the created version number looks as follows:

#### Example 1, automated build in a GoCD pipeline
* git tag such as `1.0` exists
* there are NO commits behind `1.0`, the commit distance is 0
* the build is executed in a GoCD pipeline with `GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER=153.1`):

```
# (tag.commit-distance.pipeline-counter)
version = 1.0.0.153.1
```

#### Example 2, manual (local) build on developer machine
* git tag such as `1.0` exists
* there are NO commits behind `1.0`, the commit distance is 0
* the build is executed on a computer with name ENIAC, there is no environment variable `GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER=xyz`):

```
# (tag.commit-distance-hash.computername.timestamp)
version = 1.0.0-96bfec85d4.ENIAC.20210906000609  
```

Using the `gocdVersion` closure the version schema can be configured.

```groovy

# Defaults
gocdVersion {
    appendPipelineCounterToAutomatedBuilds = true
    appendComputerNameToLocalBuilds = true
    appendTimestampToLocalBuilds = true
}
```

The effective version number schema can be verified using the `printGocdEnvironment` task on commandline.

```shell
> ./gradlew printGocdEnvironment
---------------------------------------------------
Gocd Pipeline Environment
---------------------------------------------------
GO_PIPELINE_COUNTER       = 12.1
GO_PIPELINE_NAME          = test-build
GO_PIPELINE_LABEL         = 1.12.1
GO_STAGE_NAME             = build
GO_STAGE_COUNTER          = 1
GO_SERVER_URL             = http://192.168.1.2:8053
GO_JOB_NAME               = build
GO_TRIGGER_USER           = changes
COMPUTERNAME              = ENIAC
---------------------------------------------------
Project version           = 20220526.2.12.1
Is automated build?       = true
---------------------------------------------------

```

#### Example 3, generating a MSI/WIX compatible version number from Git tag
* git tag such as `20220930` exists
* there were 12 commits after the tag, so the commit distance is 12

```
# (tag.commit-distance.pipeline-counter)
def jpkgversion = jpackageVersion(versionDetails().lastTag+'.'+versionDetails().commitDistance).build()
println(jpkgversion)
22.39.12
```
